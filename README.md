# Excercism.io Problems and Solutions

##WARNING

All the exercism.io problems already have a public solution at their Github repo.

It up to you to copy my solutions our use it only to find new ways to solve the same problema that you have already solved. 

I don't recommend you to use my solutions as yours, because by doing this you won't learn how to solve those problems and will miss a lot of knowlegde in the path to the problem resolution.

Why do I put this code here? Just to keep track of my progress and demonstrate that I have some Ruby skills too, since the Exercism.io still don't have a Github sharing feature. :-)

Happy coding!
